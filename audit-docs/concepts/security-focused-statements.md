# Problem Statements

These problem statements highlight real-world challenges faced by network administrators in ensuring security and compliance.  They provide a starting point for developing solutions that address specific security and regulatory requirements.  Remember to tailor the problem statements to your specific industry, organization, and regulatory environment.

# Security Focused Problem Statements

1. **Secure Remote Access for Developers:**  "Developers require frequent access to the web servers in the DMZ for maintenance and updates, but current access methods (e.g., direct VPN connections) pose a security risk.  Design and implement a secure remote access solution that minimizes the attack surface while providing developers with the necessary access privileges."

2. **Database Security Hardening:** "The database server contains sensitive customer data and is a prime target for attackers. Develop and implement a comprehensive database security hardening plan that includes encryption, access controls, auditing, and vulnerability management to meet regulatory requirements and protect against data breaches."

3. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention:**  "The current network lacks an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS). Design and deploy an IDS/IPS solution that can effectively detect and block malicious activity targeting the web servers, database server, and internal network, while minimizing false positives and performance impact."

4. **Firewall Management and Optimization:**  "The existing firewall rules are complex and difficult to manage.  Develop a strategy to streamline firewall management, including regular reviews, automated rule updates, and improved documentation, to ensure the firewall effectively protects the network without hindering legitimate traffic."

5. **Vulnerability Management:** "The organization needs a proactive approach to identify and address security vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure.  Implement a vulnerability management program that includes regular scanning, risk assessment, and timely patching of identified vulnerabilities."

# Compliance-Focused Problem Statements

6. **PCI DSS Compliance for Cardholder Data:** "The web server processes cardholder data, requiring compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).  Develop and implement a plan to ensure the network architecture and security controls meet all PCI DSS requirements."

7. **GDPR Compliance for User Data:** "The organization stores and processes personal data of EU citizens, requiring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Implement the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure GDPR compliance, including data encryption, access controls, and data breach notification procedures."

8. **HIPAA Compliance for Healthcare Data:** "(If applicable) The organization handles protected health information (PHI), requiring compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Design and implement a network architecture and security controls that meet HIPAA requirements for protecting PHI."

9. **Compliance Auditing and Reporting:**  "The organization needs a robust system for auditing security controls and generating reports to demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations.  Develop and implement a compliance auditing and reporting framework that can efficiently track compliance status and provide evidence for audits."
