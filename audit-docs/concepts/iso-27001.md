# About ISO-27001

The A.1, A.2, etc., you see in ISO 27001 refer to the sections within Annex A.  **Annex A contains the reference set of controls taken from ISO 27002.**  They are *not* the requirements of ISO 27001 itself but rather a suggested list of controls an organization *might* choose to implement.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Clauses 4-10:** These are the main clauses of ISO 27001 and outline the *requirements* for an Information Security Management System (ISMS). They tell you *what* you need to do.

* **Annex A:** This is an *informative* annex (meaning it's not mandatory to follow every single part of it).  It provides a list of controls aligned with ISO 27002.  It gives you examples of *how* you might address the requirements of clauses 4-10.

* **A.5 through A.18 (in the 2013 version, or A.5 through A.14 in the 2022 version):**  These are the sections within Annex A that group controls based on control objectives.  For example:

    * **A.5 Information security policies (2013 and 2022)**
    * **A.6 Organization of information security (2013), A.6 Information security roles and responsibilities (2022)**
    * **A.7 Human resource security (2013), A.7 People security (previously A.8 in 2013) (2022)**
    * **A.8 Asset management (2013), A.8 Asset management (2022)**
    * **And so on...**

**Important Points:**

* **Not Mandatory:** You are *not required* to implement every control listed in Annex A.
* **Risk-Based Approach:** ISO 27001 mandates a risk-based approach.  You must conduct a risk assessment (Clause 6.1.2) to identify your organization's specific information security risks.  Based on the results of this assessment, you *select* the controls from Annex A (or other sources) that are appropriate to address those risks.
* **Statement of Applicability (SoA):**  You must create a Statement of Applicability (Clause 6.1.3 d) that lists the controls you have selected from Annex A (or elsewhere) and explains why you chose them (or why you omitted any controls from Annex A). This document becomes the core of your ISMS and is subject to audit.

In short, the A. sections are groupings of controls within Annex A, which serves as a menu of potential security controls.  You choose the controls from this menu that best suit your organization's needs based on your risk assessment.
