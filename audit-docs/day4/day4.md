How company deciee policies? Companies decide or their customers and the losses (possible) there can occur, meaning that if company faces any issue often, there needs to be risk assesment.

- Create a base line, the top executives and management will decide what is that baseline that they are going to accept, meaning what are the risks that they need to mitigate.

- It is not only about the decision that are taken, there also needs to be the regular inspection on what is going on whether the things are taken care or not.

- Not only this, when it is about the production, meaning you need to ensure that all the possible 

# SOC/SOX

Security Operation Centre, That department that handles all security level operation, *read team* and *blue team* comes under this, meaning there is standard about it, meaning that it invovles what kind of standards are to be followed, but it depends more or less on the company, they can do their own thing.

But another is System ad organisation control, which was developed by the America, as the purpose it server is 

There were two problems that was shared, as this was regarding the transprancy of the auditing.
- If you are running your data on an EC2 instances then what kind of securty you have about the compilance, what kind of 

1. **SOC1** - It is basically the Financial report
2. **SOC2** - It is the security audit reports
3. **SOC3** - It is summary of SOC2

You won't find a single "SOC 1" or "SOC 2" report for all of AWS.  AWS offers a variety of services, and each service may have its own SOC reports.  You need to identify the *specific* AWS services you're using and then look for the corresponding reports.

When searching for AWS SOC reports, you'll often encounter entries like these, which represent different aspects of their compliance and assurance program:

To find the correct SOC reports for your AWS usage:

1. **Identify the specific AWS services** you're using that handle sensitive data or are relevant to financial reporting.
2. **Log in to AWS Artifact.**
3. **Search for the SOC 1 and/or SOC 2 reports** corresponding to those specific services.


Don't expect a single, overarching SOC report for all of AWS. The reports are tailored to individual services and their specific control environments.  AWS Artifact is the key to finding what you need.

*So what is Security Operation Control?* It is the 

# Sarbance-Oxley Act

This is because of problems again, as one of the major problem can be discussed as below:

When it comes to the high-end executives, they lead with wrong information and sometimes it creates big problem in the trade industry, if the information is not right, then it could happen in this way. 

SOX has standard that try solving prblems to the problems that are running in the real world. It is basically the more practical and more real problem that can occur due to any misleading infromation, it is about addressing the information is not getting misleaded.

# Orange Book

1. **Security Policies** - There must be an explicit and well-defined security policy enforeced by the system, as it is important to 

6. **Assurance** - All the bit-level commands are inspected and the processes whether the commands are doing the same job as that it is expected to perform, and therefore you need to check, these security flaws are checked and inspected in sperate labs where this continuos monitoring is performed.


# Evaluation Criteria

# SSE-CMM

Basically the base purpose of the reviews were to achieve the goal, as to identify what id getting left, and to find out what is the problem. In order to achieve the goal, it is important that product vision is achieved and not only that, along with product vision, there should be more secured mechanism to protect the needs of the organisation.
