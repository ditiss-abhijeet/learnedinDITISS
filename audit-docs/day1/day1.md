# Introduction to CIA

What kind of data organisation as a whole carries, and what kind of information you are protecting, these are the kind of information that the organisations are looking asnwers for, so you might ask what id CIA.

- **Confidentiality**, meaning the data should be only visible to the authorised users, menaing that it shouldn't be disclosed to unauthorised users. For example, if you birth date, which is you confidential data, in confidentiality we discuss what is the data and how to protect its value that it holds, in order such that it is not compromised.

- **Integrity** - Data Modification should be, meaning no one should be able to look at data

*What is difference between the Confidentiality and Privacy?* There is a slight differnce between the two, meaning if there is an organisation their data needs confidentiality and if there is a user, who needs certain rights and then users should be hold responsible for their own data, meaning users should be holding responsible for what kind of organisation they are sharing their data. 

*What do you mean by Vulnerability?* It can be loopholes in the system that requires regular check-ups in the system and which can require regular attention. 

What is difference between software vulnerability and hardware

*What is difference between Threat and Vulnerabilty?*

*what is threats?* These are the possible negative events that might bring harm to the software system or hardware.

*What is Exploit?* It is the method that is used to corrupt the software system and cause threat to the organisation, such as **buffer overflow** where buffer is filled with the data such that is called Exploiting the comman vulnerability, thus that is exploiting. Thus, the method like speacial code, speacial input to the system/software that uses the vulnerability is called Exploit.

*What is Risk?* Every organisation has risk to the data breaches, meaning the financial or any other kind of loss due to the threat.

*What is the difference between Information Security and Cyber Security?* When you are protecting the informatino whcih may be paper format, digital format and intangible, but *what does tangible mean?* when a developer write a code and stores it in a file, but the developer might be knowing about the very code he wrote, it is possbile for him to leave the company and write the same code again. *What about Cyber Security?* Cyber Security is protecting the information stored ...

*What is Risk Assessment?* 

-  **Data Classification**, meaning finding out the most important infromation to leasst important information, meaning what kind of information, *if it beocmes public to all, then what will be the consequences*, the answers will decide whether the data is important of not. 
  - **What will happen if the information gets disclosed?**
  - **What if the information gets modified?**, menaing if the integrity is compromised, meaning if someone is able to modify the information, what will happen.
  - **What if the inforamtion becomes unavailable?**
  - **What is the value of the information and what is the age of the information**
- **Asset Identification**, meaning identification of assets, meaning you need to look for tangible and intangible assests that stores critical information of the organisaiton, so you need to search for all those servers that are storing the critical information. 
- **Threat Idenification**, meanin identify all possible threats which are very important assets for an organisation.

  - **Analogy**, Imagine you are appearing the exam, and then you are chossing to leave few topics the possible threat is that you might see something of those question from the left out topics, the possible risk is what will be the affect of it, you might fail! So make a plan for it, you need to mitigate the possible risks.

  - **Natural threats**, such as Fire, Earthquakes, and kind of natural disasters.
  - **Technological threats**, such as HVAC Failure, Component failure, and others such as switch, mother board, and hard disks.
  - **Human based threats**, such as Bomb, Hacking, Strike, stampade, and terrorism, greed and anger. 

- **Creating Threat Agents**, It is creating a threat agent that mentions all the threats that are possible and can cause a possible threats that needs to be mentioned specifically, as you need to anitcipate the threats acutely.
    - An earthquake amay damage entire data centre.
    - A hard disk failure that can make data unavailable 
    - An administrator may format all the servers out of rage.
    
You need to make a threat statement of all the possbile threats and you need to point what is affecting what, suppose the first statement is affecting the **Availability**

- **Risk Assesment**

- Identify all possible threats from the threat list.
- Bases on history and Industry

So we need to prepare a final list where you'll realise only threat agents where you get the most possible threat that might exist and rate them accordingly of how this will affect the company, because it would be about the budget, as it is compulsory what kind of threats are of most importance.

# Threat in Mac

- **Techological Threats**: Compromisable Password
- **Natural Threats**: Fire, brokern, etc.
- **Human-based threats**: Hacking, 


# Auditing

- **Internal Security audits**
  - Intenal employee relations may not give real information

  - Limited Knowledge
    - New threats
    - New technologies

  - Other Factors
    - Total Work
    - Overtime Paid

### VAPT Audits

What it does is it check if the firewalls are working correctly, whether they are performing tasks that they should be, wherether they are performing the same way.
