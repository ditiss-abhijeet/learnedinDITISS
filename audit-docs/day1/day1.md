# Introduction to CIA

What kind of data organisation as a whole carries, and what kind of information you are protecting, these are the kind of information that the organisations are looking asnwers for, so you might ask what is CIA.

- **Confidentiality**, meaning the data should be only visible to the authorised users, menaing that it shouldn't be disclosed to unauthorised users. For example, if you birth date, which is you confidential data, in confidentiality we discuss what is the data and how to protect its value that it holds, in order such that it is not compromised.

- **Integrity** - Data Modification should be, meaning no one should be able to look at data and manipulate it. Integrity involes the **accuracy** and **reliability** of data, tapering with data will cause various organisational loses, for example, in case of Coca-Cola, tampering with the formula will cause the disruptions and losses, for example, wrong sales data could lead to wrong maketing strategy and therefore the should be an accuracy to data flowing within the organisation.

- **Availability** - Talking about Coca-Cola, there should be a continuous flow of data within the organisation to the authorised users, meaning a single downtime in sales system or manufacturing could lead to loses within financial department and reputational loses. 


*What is difference between the Confidentiality and Privacy?* There is a slight differnce between the two, meaning if there is an **organisation** their data needs confidentiality, meaning they should be able to protect their data from unauthorised users and entity, but when it is about a **user**, a user should have certain rights so that user can hold responsibilty of their data, meaning *they can control their data*, decide who can use it and who cannot, they can control and objectify where their data is going, who is using their data.

*What do you mean by Vulnerability?* It can be loopholes in the system that requires regular check-ups in the system and which can require regular attention. 

*What is difference between software vulnerability and hardware vaulnerability?* If we talk about software vul, then it could be any design, code, or logical flaw that could create a possible threat to the system. But if it is Hardware vulnerabilty, it could be anything like any Hardware Torjans as implementing any malicius hardware component, then it could be **Unsecured fireware** meaning there could be 

*what is threats?* These are the possible negative events that might bring harm to the software system or hardware.

*What is difference between Threat and Vulnerabilty?* When we talk about threat, threat is a possible or potential for mishappening, say any unwanted event, a hacker may exploit your vulnerability, or there could be a disgruntled employee who can cause a inside threat. But when we talk about the Vulnerability, these are loopholes that can cause disruption to the operation within the organisation, could affect the availability, confidentiality, or integrity of data.  

*What is Risk?* Risk is the potential of loss, which could do damage to the organisation, potential financial loss, operational disruption, legal panelty due to any resultant to the *vulnerability that got expoited*.

*What is Exploit?* It is the method that is used to corrupt the software system and cause threat to the organisation, such as **buffer overflow** where buffer is filled with the data such that is called Exploiting the comman vulnerability, thus that is exploiting. Thus, the method like speacial code, speacial input to the system/software that uses the vulnerability is called Exploit.

*What is Risk?* Every organisation has risk to the data breaches, meaning the financial or any other kind of loss due to the threat.

*What is the difference between Information Security and Cyber Security?* When you are protecting the informatino whcih may be paper format, digital format and intangible, but *what does tangible mean?* when a developer write a code and stores it in a file, but the developer might be knowing about the very code he wrote, it is possbile for him to leave the company and write the same code again. *What about Cyber Security?* Cyber Security is protecting the information stored ...

*What is Risk Assessment?* 

-  **Data Classification**, meaning finding out the most important infromation to leasst important information, meaning what kind of information, *if it beocmes public to all, then what will be the consequences*, the answers will decide whether the data is important of not. 
  - **What will happen if the information gets disclosed?**
  - **What if the information gets modified?**, menaing if the integrity is compromised, meaning if someone is able to modify the information, what will happen.
  - **What if the inforamtion becomes unavailable?**
  - **What is the value of the information and what is the age of the information**
- **Asset Identification**, meaning identification of assets, meaning you need to look for tangible and intangible assests that stores critical information of the organisaiton, so you need to search for all those servers that are storing the critical information. 
- **Threat Idenification**, meanin identify all possible threats which are very important assets for an organisation.

  - **Analogy**, Imagine you are appearing the exam, and then you are chossing to leave few topics the possible threat is that you might see something of those question from the left out topics, the possible risk is what will be the affect of it, you might fail! So make a plan for it, you need to mitigate the possible risks.

  - **Natural threats**, such as Fire, Earthquakes, and kind of natural disasters.
  - **Technological threats**, such as HVAC Failure, Component failure, and others such as switch, mother board, and hard disks.
  - **Human based threats**, such as Bomb, Hacking, Strike, stampade, and terrorism, greed and anger. 

- **Creating Threat Agents**, It is creating a threat agent that mentions all the threats that are possible and can cause a possible threats that needs to be mentioned specifically, as you need to anitcipate the threats acutely.
    - An earthquake amay damage entire data centre.
    - A hard disk failure that can make data unavailable 
    - An administrator may format all the servers out of rage.
    
You need to make a threat statement of all the possbile threats and you need to point what is affecting what, suppose the first statement is affecting the **Availability**

- **Risk Assesment**

- Identify all possible threats from the threat list.
- Bases on history and Industry

So we need to prepare a final list where you'll realise only threat agents where you get the most possible threat that might exist and rate them accordingly of how this will affect the company, because it would be about the budget, as it is compulsory what kind of threats are of most importance.

# Threat in Mac

- **Techological Threats**: Compromisable Password
- **Natural Threats**: Fire, brokern, etc.
- **Human-based threats**: Hacking, 

# Compliance 

*What is compliance?* Compliance is ensuring that there are rules and regulations r standards that are being followed within the organisation, it can be **internal** (for example, company
code of conduct) or **external** (for example, HIPAA, PCI DSS etc). This is called adherene to the rules. Basically we can define what compliance involves:

- **Adherence to rules**, meaning there should be proper standards, rules, and regulation to be followed, can be internal as well as external, for example companies own code of conducts or any compliance standard, such as 

- **Risk Management** - By adhering to rules, the organisation tries to prevents various risks, such as financial loses, operation disruption, legal panelties and all

- **Accountabilty** - COmpliance also make sure that there are people who are given responsibility to look after certain rules and regulation or say compliance requirements, such as there should be people holding reponsible, when something goes wrong.


# Auditing

Auditing is independent inspection of whether the organisaiton is *compliant* or not. Auditor is a sperate entity that is seperate from the entity that are being audited. So an Auditor is a seperate entity that checks for the processes and alignment within the organisation. Auditors gather evidence through interviews, observations, document reviews, and testing to support their findings.

- **Internal Security Audits**
  - Internal audits are done by the seperate auditing commitee working within the organisation, not as part of the management department of the organisation, whose job is to 
- **External Security Audits**
  - These are seperate authorities that work inddependent to the organisation and hence have extreme level of independence.
- Limited Knowledge
  - New threats
  - New technologies

- Other Factors
  - Total Work
  - Overtime Paid

### VAPT Audits

It is **Vulnerability Assesment and Penetration testing** audits that work for the identification as well as exploiting the possible vulnerability of the system. 

- **Vulnerability Assessment** - This is to identify the possible vulnerability within the system and then 
- **Penetration Testing** - This focusses on exploiting the identified vulnerability.

Thus the goal is always to identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
