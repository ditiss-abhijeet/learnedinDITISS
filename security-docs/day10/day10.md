###  `which nmap`

This is to identify the vulnerability in the infrastructure, or when you are working with network vulnerability, it is an open source tool for inspection of the infrastructure flaws. It is designed to scan large networks, while it is used by network administrators but sometimes it is used for auditing as well. 

Use the following command in order to s an the OS dependent services working over the network. It is the fingerprinting tool that leaves the footprints of the nmap and therefore it is not recommended.

```
nmap -A 192.168.0.116
```

Use the following command to ping without giving the ping or say without using for the discovery protocols.

```
nmap -Pn 192.168.0.116
```

Use the following ping command to know what are the devices that are active on the network, meaning it will list all the *pingable* device on the network.

```
sudo nmap -sp 172.16.0.0/21
```
