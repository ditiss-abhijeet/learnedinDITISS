# Social Engineering

Whom you are sending the link, getting the location, getting the username and password with the friend and connected over the facebook, and the very reason why we are trying to do this is to let people reveal their credential, and therefore we can define, social engineering is the *art of convincing people to reveal their confidential information*. So social engineering is about identifying the people who are not aware of the technolgy and therfore we can use this. Another part of it is that **Information**, from where you are going to utilise the information, meaning you need to think and analyse from where you are going to get these information. 

The Impact of attack on organisation could be very serious as it could include Economic Loss, Loss of privacy, Lawsuit and arbitration and Dangers of Terrorism. We are are not only talking about the impact, but we are also talking about awareness.

- All our data is breached, but what we see is that we are secure on our individual devices, as that is not real. 

# Phases of Social Engineering Attack

The First thing is you need to consider each and every information where first you need to start the **research**, meaing **research of the organisation**. 

- You need to perform the few activities, such as visit the companies scenario.
- Select the Victim, meaning identify the frustrated employee of the target company.
- Then you need to develop the relationship withthe selected employees and therefore all of this to get the information out.
- Exploit the relationship and collect the information.
- Dumster driving
- Reverse social engineering
- Piggybacking 
- Taigating

# Computer Based Social Engineering Attack

Phishing has various names and you can also calle it branch spoofing and scan to seatl valuable infromation such as credit cards, social secirity numbner, user IDs, passwords. Official-looking emails sent to potential victims, that pretends as if their ISPs and retail stoers are sending these emails to them. 

You need to start by making an environement where you can decide what kind of information you need to build the story. So what you need to do is that you need to first gather information, and what kind of information would be needed in order to create.

# WireShark

*So can you see the Network Traffic from the wireshark?* 

*How can you capture the three way handshake?* YOu first need to capture for a particul IP address for the, say any website for the inspection.

- First take the IP address of the website, and then go and use the Browser and then try looking for the website.
- Go to the website, meaning when you'll be trying to making a connection with the website, you'll notice the first three messages are **SYN** messages, such that these are establishing the connection with the webiste on dst IP address.

Remember that you can also sniff the data if you are sending a website that is running on your localhost and then you can sniff the username and passwords from the website, using WireShark.

# What does this do?

# Preferences in WireShark 

- You can configure your pane in wireshark with multiple options like, how you want to see the informations, which is devided into three Pane.

- You can also add **Delta Time**, meaning it tells what is the time gap between the two. 

- You can also add your coloring rules, for example for TCP SYN, you can add a color and 

# OSINT

It is an framework that follows what kind of breaches can be performed. You can go to [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com). OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.

# Basic Things Required Everywhere in Cyber Security

Below are the most important topics of the 

- IPv4 Addressing - Classes, Loopback ranges, Private IP ranges, and Subnetting and Calculation. Identifying IP, default gateway, DNS server, Alternate DNS server, DHCP.
- Alternate IP Configuration (In Windows).
- OSI, TCP/IP Modals
- Router, Switches, Repeaters. Networking devices.
- IPv4 Header and Ethernet
- Finger Commands
- Wireless Wifi, and Ethernet working.
- Public IP, Private IP and Static and Dynamic IP.
- IP, MAC, and Port Numbers

When talking about the Linux, you need to take all that there is about the FHS (File Hierarchical System), need to read from the resources *fhslinux.com*
