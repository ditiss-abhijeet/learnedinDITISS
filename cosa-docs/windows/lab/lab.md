# Creating Domain

You can create a domain with Primary, Secondary, and Stub, but remember there si another option *Store the zone in Active Directory*, which means that you can create the replica on all the domains, and therefore you need to plan first, if you need a ADC over the domain, and therefore if try enabling the *checkbox*, you will get the replica of all the resources.
