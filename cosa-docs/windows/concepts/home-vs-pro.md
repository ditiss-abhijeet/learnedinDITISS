# Home Edition vs Pro Edition

There are several adminitrative differences between the Home edtion and Pro edtion, and that is why it is important to know what is the requirement and what kind of OS edition you might need within your organisation:

- Home edition lacks several feature such as **BitLocker encryption**, **Remote Desktop hosting**, and **Hyper-V** Virtualisation, and **Group Policy**.

- Remember though there are several administrative feature in the windows **Pro** edition, yet it not designed for handling the **servers**. For that you might need **Windows Server**

- Such tasks where you need to, host websites, running multiple VMs for hundreds of users, and managing databases. 

### Windows Server

- Windows server editions are designed for **Enterprise-level tasks**, which provide high-end feature such as **AD (Active Directory)**, **DNS** management, **DHCP** configruation, including **Hyper-V** virtualisation for various users and **extensive seurity** and scalability options.

- Remember these **Window Desktop** edition are for **End Users**, has lots for features for their management, but the **Server** is lot more capable, as you need to manage servers, manage DNS, manage users and network, also your organisation need to consider the scalability options.
