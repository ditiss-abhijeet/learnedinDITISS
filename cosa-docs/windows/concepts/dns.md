# DNS 

In windows server DNS mirrors all the components of the Active Directory to resolve the Ip addresses, names, and services within the forest. Network hosts (computers, devices, and hosts) and applications (Web services, database etc.) rely on DNS for the proper communication within the network or forest.

# Why DNS? 

DNS originated in the early days of the Internet when the Internet was a small network established by the United States Department of Defense for research purposes. The host names of the computers in this network were managed through the use of a single HOSTS file located on a centrally administered server. Each site that needed to resolve host names on the network downloaded this file. As the number of hosts on the Internet grew, the traffic generated by the update process increased, as well as the size of the HOSTS file. The need for a new system, which would offer features such as scalability, decentralized administration, support for various data types, became more and more obvious.

Then we got DNS. DNS introduced in 1984 and became the new system. With DNS, the host names reside in a database that can be distributed among multiple servers, decreasing the load on any one server and providing the ability to administer this naming system on a per-partition basis. DNS supports hierarchical names and allows registration of various data types in addition to host name to IP address mapping used in HOSTS files. Because the DNS database is distributed, its potential size is unlimited and performance is not degraded when more servers are added.

# Domain Names

These domain names are path for the hosts such that they can identified within the hierarchical tree structure in which DNS saves its database. DNS database is saved in an hierarchical structure which is **Domain Namespace**, for example if there is a domain name say, mydomain.cdac.com, then this is called FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). 

# Lets Understand DNS Domain Namespace

# Resource Records

**Resource Records (RRs)** are the building blocks of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is like the phonebook of the internet. These records contain important information about different services and hosts (computers, servers) on a network. 

When you type a website address (like `example.com`), the DNS looks at these records to figure out where (which IP address) that domain name should take you. Think of these records as little notes that the DNS system reads to understand how to handle your request.

### Common Types of Resource Records:
1. **SOA (Start of Authority)**: This record holds information about the DNS zone (like a chunk of the internet controlled by a certain organization), including details on who manages it and how often updates happen.

   - **Example**: The SOA record might say, "This part of the internet is managed by `primarynameserver.com` and is updated every 60 minutes."

2. **A Record (Address Record)**: This record translates domain names into IP addresses. When you type in `www.example.com`, the A record tells DNS, "Send this request to IP address `192.168.1.1`."

   - **Example**: `www.example.com` -> `192.168.1.1`

3. **NS (Name Server Record)**: This record shows which server is responsible for answering DNS queries for a domain. Itâ€™s like saying, "If you have a question about `example.com`, ask this specific server."

   - **Example**: `example.com` is handled by the nameserver `ns1.example.com`.

4. **MX (Mail Exchanger Record)**: This tells the DNS where to deliver emails for a domain. It points to the mail server responsible for accepting email on behalf of the domain.

   - **Example**: "For emails sent to `@example.com`, deliver them to the mail server at `mail.example.com`."

5. **CNAME (Canonical Name Record)**: This is like a nickname for a domain. It allows one domain to point to another. For example, `blog.example.com` might be a nickname for `www.example.com`.

   - **Example**: `blog.example.com` -> `www.example.com`

When you visit a website, send an email, or use online services, these resource records help direct your request to the right place. They ensure your browser knows the correct server IP address for a website, or your email knows which mail server to use for delivery.

# DNS Delegation

It is nothing but the seperation of domains within a domain, for example `example.com` is a single domain and there can be `one.example.com` and `two.example.com` which are delegation of the domain `example.com`, and therefore delegation never work alone, it work with **NS (Name Server)** Record. It resolves the delgation for the specific domain and tells DNS what domain it needs to reach out.
