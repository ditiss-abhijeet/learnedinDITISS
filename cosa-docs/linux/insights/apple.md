# Apple Uses Custom SSD Controller

Apple uses its APFS (Apple File System) or to deal with the SSD Controllers which are optimized for SSDs, it uses the **Snapshot** technology that handles backups

# UMA (Unified Memory Architecture)

Classically there is bottleneck in the approach of having a seperate memory for the CPU, GPU and every time any operation needs to be performed, there is a duplicaiton of resource and its time consuming. 

Apple uses Unified Memory Architecture, quite different from the classical apporach, where CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine uses the same Memory Pool, no duplicaiton or resources.
