The `case` statement in shell scripting is similar to **switch-case** statements in other programming languages (such as C, Java, or Python). It provides a way to perform different actions based on the value of a variable or expression.

### **Logical Concept of `case` in Shell Scripting:**

- **Purpose**: The `case` statement is used to simplify decision-making when you have multiple conditions or patterns to evaluate. Itâ€™s ideal when you need to match a variable or expression against different possible values or patterns and execute corresponding blocks of code.
  
- **How it works**:
  - You define a variable or an expression to test.
  - You specify several possible patterns for that variable.
  - Each pattern is associated with a block of code that executes if the pattern matches the value.
  - If none of the patterns match, you can have a default block using `*)`, which will execute if no conditions are met.

### **Syntax of `case` in Shell Scripting**:
```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # commands to execute if pattern1 matches
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # commands to execute if pattern2 matches
        ;;
    *)
        # default case, executes if no other pattern matches
        ;;
esac
```
- **expression**: The variable or value being evaluated.
- **pattern1, pattern2, ...**: These are the different possible values (or patterns) the expression might take.
- **`;;`**: Marks the end of each case statement.
- **`*)`**: Represents the default case, executed if no other patterns match.

### **Example: Basic Case Statement (Menu System)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number between 1 and 3:"
read number

case $number in
    1)
        echo "You chose option 1."
        ;;
    2)
        echo "You chose option 2."
        ;;
    3)
        echo "You chose option 3."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid option. Please enter a number between 1 and 3."
        ;;
esac
```

### **How It Works:**
- The user inputs a number.
- The `case` statement checks the value of `number`:
  - If `number` is `1`, it executes the block associated with `1`.
  - If `number` is `2`, it executes the block associated with `2`.
  - If `number` is `3`, it executes the block associated with `3`.
  - If the value is anything else, the `*)` block runs, which handles invalid inputs.

### **Example: Using Patterns with Wildcards**

The `case` statement can match more than just exact values. It can match patterns using wildcards like `*` and `?`.

#### Example: Matching Multiple Strings
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a fruit name (apple, orange, banana):"
read fruit

case $fruit in
    apple)
        echo "You chose Apple."
        ;;
    orange)
        echo "You chose Orange."
        ;;
    banana)
        echo "You chose Banana."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown fruit!"
        ;;
esac
```

### **Pattern Matching Using Wildcards**:
```bash
case $input in
    [a-z]*)   # Matches strings starting with a lowercase letter
        echo "Starts with a lowercase letter."
        ;;
    [0-9]*)   # Matches strings starting with a digit
        echo "Starts with a digit."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Doesn't start with a lowercase letter or digit."
        ;;
esac
```
In this case:
- `[a-z]*)` matches any string that starts with a lowercase letter.
- `[0-9]*)` matches any string that starts with a number.
- `*` matches anything else.

### **Example: Case for Menu Choices with Multiple Values**

You can also group multiple options in a single pattern, which is great for **menu-based systems**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Choose an option: (start, stop, restart)"
read option

case $option in
    start|START)
        echo "Starting the service..."
        ;;
    stop|STOP)
        echo "Stopping the service..."
        ;;
    restart|RESTART)
        echo "Restarting the service..."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid option!"
        ;;
esac
```

- Here, the pattern `start|START` matches either "start" or "START".
- Similarly, `stop|STOP` matches both cases for "stop".
- This helps in handling case-insensitive input from the user without writing duplicate code.

### **Example: File Extension Matching**
The `case` statement is also helpful for identifying file types based on file extensions.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a filename:"
read filename

case $filename in
    *.txt)
        echo "This is a text file."
        ;;
    *.jpg | *.jpeg)
        echo "This is an image file."
        ;;
    *.sh)
        echo "This is a shell script."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown file type."
        ;;
esac
```

### **How It Works**:
- The case statement checks the extension of the file entered.
  - `*.txt` matches any file ending with `.txt`.
  - `*.jpg | *.jpeg` matches files ending with either `.jpg` or `.jpeg`.
  - `*.sh` matches shell scripts with `.sh` extension.
  - `*` is the default case for any other file types.

### **Summary of Logical Features of `case`**:

1. **Pattern Matching**: `case` can match exact values, patterns using wildcards, or groups of values.
2. **Default Case (`*`)**: It always executes if no other patterns match, ensuring some logic is always run for unexpected inputs.
3. **Simplifies Multi-way Decision Making**: Instead of using multiple `if-elif` statements, `case` provides a clean, readable structure when you have multiple cases to handle.
4. **Variable Evaluation**: It works well with both user inputs and programmatic variables, adapting to different scenarios.

### **Use Cases of `case`**:
- **Menu Systems**: Useful for simple menu-based scripts, where users pick options like `start`, `stop`, `exit`, etc.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures inputs are handled properly and fallback mechanisms are in place.
- **File Handling**: Differentiates behavior based on file extensions or names.
- **Script Execution**: Matches different command-line arguments to execute various parts of a script.

By using `case`, you can simplify your script's decision-making logic, making it easier to read and maintain, especially when handling many potential values or patterns.
