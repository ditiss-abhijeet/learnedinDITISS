# What is the logical Difference between Switch and Routers?

The distinction between the Switches and Routers can be made using the following factors, remember it is important to realise the technical difference between the router and switches such that both of them work on different layers of OSI modal and switches do not have IP address and can't identify networks while routers don't deal with collision domains and are only sending the relevant broadcast messages. So apart from the technical difference we'll discuss the logical difference between the two based on the following factors below.

### Collision Domains

#### **Switch**:
- A switch **breaks up collision domains**. Every port on a switch creates a separate collision domain, meaning each device connected to a switch port can send data simultaneously without the risk of collision (unlike hubs).

- A switch, by default, **does not break up broadcast domains**. This means all devices on a switch still receive broadcasts from any device in the network, which can lead to **broadcast storms**.

#### **Router**:
- Routers don't deal with collision domains, as they operate at a higher level in the OSI model.

- A router **breaks up broadcast domains**. This is critical in larger networks because it prevents broadcast traffic (like ARP requests or DHCP offers) from overwhelming the network. Routers act as a gatekeeper, forwarding only relevant traffic between networks.
