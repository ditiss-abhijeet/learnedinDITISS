# Use Multiple Hash Algorithms 

Here are several hash functions you can use in Linux to verify your image, along with the commands to generate them:

1. **SHA-256 (Recommended):**  Currently considered the most robust and widely recommended hashing algorithm for security purposes.

   ```bash
   sha256sum image.img
   ```

2. **SHA-512 (Even Stronger):**  A longer hash function than SHA-256, providing even greater collision resistance.

   ```bash
   sha512sum image.img
   ```

3. **SHA-1 (Older, Less Recommended):**  While once widely used, SHA-1 is now considered cryptographically broken due to discovered vulnerabilities.  It's best to avoid SHA-1 for critical verification, but it can still be used as a secondary check.

   ```bash
   sha1sum image.img
   ```

4. **MD5 (Older, Not Recommended for Security):**  MD5 is significantly weaker than the SHA-2 family and is known to be vulnerable to collisions.  It's generally not recommended for security-sensitive applications but can be used as an additional check alongside stronger algorithms.

   ```bash
   md5sum image.img
   ```

5. **BLAKE2 (Strong and Fast):** BLAKE2 is a strong and fast cryptographic hash function, often considered a good alternative to SHA-2 and SHA-3.  You might need to install the `b2sum` package (e.g., `sudo apt install b2sum` on Debian/Ubuntu).  There are variants like BLAKE2b (longer hash) and BLAKE2s (optimized for smaller data).

   ```bash
   b2sum image.img # BLAKE2b by default
   b2sum -l 256 image.img # BLAKE2b with 256-bit output
   ```
