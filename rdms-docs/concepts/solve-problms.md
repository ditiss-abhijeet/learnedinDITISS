# Problem Statments

Here are some problem statements to help you practice your MySQL concepts, ranging from basic to more advanced:

**Basic:**

1. **Retrieve data:** Write a query to select all columns and rows from the `Employees` table.
2. **Filter data:**  Select employees from the `Employees` table who work in the 'Sales' department.
3. **Sort data:**  Select all employees and order them by salary in descending order.
4. **Calculate aggregate values:** Find the average salary of all employees.
5. **Limit results:** Select the top 5 highest-paid employees.
6. **Use wildcard characters:**  Select employees whose names start with 'A'.
7. **Join two tables:**  Retrieve employee names and their department names from the `Employees` and `Departments` tables (assuming you have a `department_id` in both).
8. **Group data:**  Find the number of employees in each department.
9. **Use subqueries:** Select employees whose salaries are higher than the average salary.
10. **Work with dates:** Select orders placed in the last month.

**Intermediate:**

11. **Combine multiple conditions:** Select employees who work in 'Sales' and earn more than $60,000.
12. **Use `CASE` expressions:** Categorize employees based on their salary ranges (e.g., low, medium, high).
13. **Work with string functions:** Extract the first name from the `name` column.
14. **Create and use views:** Create a view that shows employee names and their department names.
15. **Use stored procedures:** Create a stored procedure to add a new employee to the `Employees` table.
16. **Handle NULL values:** Select employees whose manager is not assigned (assuming you have a `manager_id` column that can be NULL).
17. **Use `UNION` and `UNION ALL`:** Combine results from multiple `SELECT` statements.
18. **Work with indexes:** Create an index on the `salary` column to improve query performance.
19. **Understand transactions:**  Perform a series of operations within a transaction to ensure data consistency.
20. **Import and export data:** Import data from a CSV file into a table and export data from a table to a CSV file.

**Advanced:**

21. **Optimize queries:** Analyze a slow-performing query and optimize it using indexes, rewriting queries, or other techniques.
22. **Design database schema:** Design a database schema for a specific application, considering normalization and relationships between tables.
23. **Work with triggers:** Create a trigger that updates a log table whenever a new employee is added.
24. **Implement full-text search:** Create a full-text index on a text column and use full-text search queries to find relevant information.
25. **Use user-defined functions:** Create a function to calculate a specific value based on input parameters.
26. **Manage user accounts and privileges:** Create new users, grant and revoke privileges, and manage security aspects of the database.
27. **Implement database replication:** Set up master-slave replication to improve availability and read performance.
28. **Understand different storage engines:** Compare and contrast different storage engines (e.g., InnoDB, MyISAM) and choose the appropriate one for your needs.
29. **Work with partitions:** Partition a large table to improve query performance.
30. **Use stored programs for complex logic:** Implement complex business logic using stored procedures and functions.


These problem statements will help you to test various SQL concepts.  Remember to practice these concepts using a sample database so that you can immediately apply what you are learning. You can create your own dummy data, or use publicly available sample databases.  Try to solve these problems using different approaches and compare the results.  This will help you to deepen your understanding of SQL and how to write efficient and effective queries.
