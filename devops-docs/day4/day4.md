# Monolithic Application

If you wanto to develop a E-commerce application, what you need is a user management, product management, then order management, and different management features that exists, and all these managment fewature are compressses to tn application, say **app.jar**, the whole application crashed if any one of the feature goes bad, during the development. Therefoere the whole package will be destroyed. 

Monolithic application also doesn't allow you to implement another technology, so the implemenetation of another lanaguage, say if youworking on java, can't go to python.

Furthermore, there is more copmplexity, where there are equal 

# Microserices

Unlike Monolithic application where different management feature can be used by differndevelopers and technolgy. These microservices are develoed i different technolgies and this it is logcally connected to the application, this when it comes to mrcoservice, if the machine is comming for art, but for all teh other feature ill differnt multipl deploument.

# Containerization

Containerization is another kind of the packaging of the application within on operating system requirement that said, it is possible that you have

COntainers are less secure than virtual machine and therefore you need to make them secure, as an adminitrator, 

# Docker

It will do everything for you, it is nothing but the container runtime, and its a standardized container runtime, it will mange, run, update everyhting will be done by docker.  

# Docker v/s Docker Desktop

In prodcution server, there are two version of Docker, becuase the containers are exepected to have a **Linux**, and therefore, Docker Desktop installs a another layer of Linux Virtual Machine, but that is not the case with the production environment where there is Linux by default and there we only have to install **Docker**.
