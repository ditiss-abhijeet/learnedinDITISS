# Virtualisation

Cloud provides you the way to work with the machine that are not there, Cloud and DevOPS both are apart from each other, DevOPS is like a culture of infrastructure that is followed in IT, but the Cloud is a technology that helps us to connect something that is remote.

Creation of Actual Entrity within the Operating system, that can be used in order to Deloyment, thus adding something virtual, meaning that it is not there actually, but logically it can work. You can use two differnet operating system at the same time, multiple operating system running at the same time. 

# Network Virtualisation

A virtual Network that is used in multiple ways, but typically ISPs having the bandwidth which they offer to customers to provide internet speed.

# Storage Virtualisation

You are going to pool multiple resources for example, what appears to be more than 10GB, but is could be only 2GB of disk, where five such disks are combined to create a large Volume, this is called storage virtualisation.

#  Data Virtualisation

The data that you provide to the websites and organisation does save all that data in Database, isntead, all the data is being stoerd on differnt server in the *file** format, you can call it Software-defined Data Center.

# Desktop Virtualisation

Virtualisation is also called sharing, as you can share the Desktop where you can share the same desktop as you have, for example, **Zoom**, **Anydesk** is also one of the way of sharing the same desktop.

# Application Virtualisation

**Puppet** and **Ansible** are two of the ways of tdoing th ethings in the actiali IT environment. What you need to do is to install the puppet over theh opetating system, and then you need to start with 

# Hardware  Virtualisation

The Sharing of resources such that you are able to manipulate the hardware resources Typically there are two types, one is called Hosted and another is called Bare-Metal Virtualisation. 

### Hosted Virtualisation

Hypervisors are used at the op of the Device drivers that manges the inputs being recieved from the Outer Hardware, now that there is hypervisor that is uing the resources, the software that are used for the hypervisor, some example are VMware, Virtual Box, and all. Now what it does is that it creates a Virutal NIC, Virtual Memory, Virtual Audia, and virtual Storage. This kind of Virtualisation is called TYPE II hosted Virtualisation. 

There is Virtual Hardware that is maintained by the Hypervisor, such as VMware and VirtualBox. 

### Bare-Metal Virtualisation

The whole infrastructure of the Bare-Metal Virtualisation works on the system called *customised Linux*. This ar multiple Hypervisors that are used in order to make this work, such as XEN, VMware, ESXi. The Hypervisor is directly used over the device Drivers and it removes one more layer of Operating system. Then in that case there is no more resource allocation done by the Operating system itself. Thus, that is called TYPE I Virtualisation.  

# Virtualised Deployment

In real world, you are need to host the application over the AWS and acces the applicaiton over the internet, it means that there is are few terminologies and components.

# Before Cloud 

Earlier people were connected to unix operating system, running on server capable of computing, through the telephone line, on the end people were using a **terminal**, this terminal was connected with the telephone, and copmmand were used to pass the instruction and the inputs were send to the server and outputs were recieved on the papers, as the termials were connected with the Keyboard and Printer.  

Later this got changes to something dfferent, instead of using a terminal thre were used **Modem**, a desktop computing 

This got evolved into Desktop Computing, the computation changes everything, it was called **Desktop Computed Era**. Where every started creating their own data, and with time there came a **Client-Server Architecture**, as this changed everything as people started making their own data, and therefore the server started getting all the data, and data became the talk of theh Generation.

# Client-Server Computing

It is basically associated with the server resolving the client requests for the client re

# Cluster Computing

A scenario where you can include bunch of machiens 

# Cloud Computing

It could be a private network that is handling your requests, it is used over the internet to provide you services, such as creating Virtual Machines, creating Server, deploying application and what not. Having a server might make it vulnerable as if you tried buying 10 such server, if the demand within the coorporation decreases, that would mean loss of resorces.

## Scalability

Every application is capable enough to exapand and shrunks the number of resources that you have. This scalability can be used in order to increase or decrease the resources.

## Elasticity

It is the capability of adding the resources and decresing the resources, as you can delete the resources as you don't have to take care of how much you can add or reduce.

## Availablity

This means that you can have the resources because the base requirement of the cloud is for redundant and therefore, you change or reduce


# Management Console

Amazon has group of resoureces where there are multiple functionalities, such as services that AWS provides, so think like this, management console is the way through which you are going to take the services and resources. Thus, then there is CLI (Command Line Interface), which is basically used by the operation team to get those resources in  order to manage the reousrces for multiple programatic services.

Architects uses the Management Console, and Developers uses the SDK, Administrators or say Operation team. Lets start creating our first Virtual Machine running in Cloud.
